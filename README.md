## Notes

This week was challenging for me. In order to make my routing and components work to specification, I needed to update the previous component layout. Reconfiguring that and updating the CSS was a bit of a stuggle for me to go back through again. I also had a bit of a hard time figuring out the routing and making sure that I was passing through all the correct information.
